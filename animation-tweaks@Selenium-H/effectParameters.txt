Parameter Values - non-float ( window animations only ) 
=======================================================

MW  =  Width of Minimized window 
MH  =  Height of Minimized window

MX  =  Default X coordinate of Minimized window
MY  =  Default Y coordinate of Minimized window

LX  =  X Coordinate of window docked to left
RX  =  X Coordinate of window docked to Right

UY  =  Y Coordinate of window docked at Up 
DY  =  Y Coordinate of window docked at bottom

SX  =  Same X Coordinate as previous
SY  =  Same Y Coordinate as previous 

IX  =  Initial X Coordinate during start
IY  =  Initial Y Coordinate during start


All non float values are overridden by actual values obtained from setNextParametersWindow function at run time.


Moving Effects
==============

Moving effect Array stores two animations in a single array as follows

Effect Array   [  |  S    Name                    C       PPX       PPY       CX        CY        CZ        T         OP        SX        SY        PX        PY        TZ        RX        RY        RZ        TRN  ]

Starting    -->  '|','F'  'Fade',                 '2',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.300',  '220',    '1.0',    '1.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',   '0.0',     'easeOutCubic',  
Stopping    -->                                           '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.300',  '255',    '1.0',    '1.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',    '0.0',   '0.0',     'easeOutCubic'   
                                                        
When window movement starts driveOtherEffects function is called with temporarily initializing C = 2/2 = 1, only executes first half of Effect Array 
When window movement stops  driveOtherEffects function is called with subEffectNo = C/2, only executes second half of Effect Array
